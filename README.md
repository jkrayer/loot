## Notional Future Features

Ideas that my be completed or discarded.

1. Tie packages to icons, add player accessible menu to loot the icon, pop up loot window when the player loots
   1. Need a "chest" icon
   2. Maybe add a function to move packages from the current store to an icon and back
2. Attach random treasure roll to monsters. 
   1. Players may click a single time after death to loot the monster
   2. Treasure is rolled at that time.
3. Need, Greed, Pass for items but I think that would need a character sheet to add the "won" item too
